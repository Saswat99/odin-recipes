<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While a baked potato made in the oven is undeniably delightful, a baked potato is even more scrumptious when it’s made in an air fryer. The concentrated heat and fan in the air fryer crisps the skin of the potato to perfection while also creating light, fluffy insides, ready to be topped any way your heart desires.  </p>
<p>Achieving that crisp exterior and fluffy interior takes less time in the air fryer, meaning dinner comes together quicker. It also clears up space in the oven for other dishes and is a fantastic option for warmer days when turning on the oven is less than ideal.  </p>

<li>4 medium to medium-large russet potatoes</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil,divided</li>
<li>1/2 tablespoon kosher salt,divided,plus ,ore serving</li>
<li>Freshly grounded black paper,unsalted butter,shredded sharo cheddar,

<li><h3>Serve</h3>
<p>Remove the potatoes from the air fryer with a pair of tongs. Using a sharp knife, slice each potato through the top lengthwise (without cutting all the way through) to reveal the steamy interior.</p>
<p>Use a fork to fluff the insides of the potato. Season and top as desired with more salt, freshly ground black pepper, unsalted butter, shredded sharp cheddar, sour cream, and/or scallions. Serve immediately while the insides are still hot and the skin is still crispy.</p>
<p>The potatoes can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>
