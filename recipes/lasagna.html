<h1>Lasagna</h1>
<img src="/home/kali/Downloads/lasagna.jpg">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce
 and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the
 run-down:</p>
<p><ol><li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers,
onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes.
The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
<li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.
We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of 
tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
<li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of
 noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have
 three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li></ol><p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>For meat sauce</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>2 teaspoons extravergin olive oil</li>
<li>1 pund ground beef chunk</li>
<li>1/2 medium onion,diced(about3/4cup)</li>
<li>1/2 large bell pepper(green,red or yellow)</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
<li>28 ounce good quality tomato sauce</li>
<li>3 ounces tomato paste</li>
<li>14 ounce can crushed tomato</li>
<li>2 tablespoon chopped frash oregano or 2 teaspoons dries oregano</li>
<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
<li>1 tablespoon italian seasoning</li>
<li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar</li>
<li>salt</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>To assemble the lasagna</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li> 1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles(requires 9 lasagna noodles-unbroken)</li>

 <li> 15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>

 <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>

 <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>

</ul>
</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>Put pasta water on to boil</h3>
Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of
water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot
of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare
the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>

<li><h3>Brown the ground beef</h3>
In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat.
Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.

Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a 
tablespoon of fat.</p> <img src="/home/kali/Downloads/groundbeef.jpg"></li>

<li><h3><p>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</h3>
Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the photo we are using
yellow bell pepper and red onions).

Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers
softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.

Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the
heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>

<h3> Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce
 ingredients to build the sauce</h3>
<p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot.
Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.</p>

<p>Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to
taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.</p>

<p>Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a 0tablespoon at a
time, tasting after each addition, to taste. (The amount of sugar needed
will vary, depending on how acidic the tomatoes are that you are
using.)</p>

<p>Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, which 
is salty.</p>

<p>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low
simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of
the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.</p>

<p>Remove from heat.</p>

<h3>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</h3>
<p>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be
 boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per
 package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.)</p>

<p>Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a
full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from
 sticking.</p>

<p>When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently
separating any noodles that may be sticking together.</p>

<p>Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the
cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them over so that they get coated
with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking
together.</p>

<li><h3>Heat the oven to 375°F</h3></li>

<li>
<h3>Assemble the lasagna</h3>

<p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and
spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna
noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, edge may overlap, depending
on your pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over
the noodles.</p>

<p>Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of lasagna
 sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every
 couple inches. Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the
 top of ricotta cheese.</p>

<p>Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half of the remaining sauce.
 Add half of the remaining Mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and
 another the remaining Parmesan.</p>

<p>Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over
 the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining Mozzarella
 cheese.</p>

<h3>Bake</h3>
Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't
touch the noodles or sauce). Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. Uncover in
the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges. 
</li>

<li>
<h3>Cool and serve</h3>
Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep
for about 5 days. May be reheated in conventional oven or microwave. Leave
aluminum tent on for storage. (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching
the sauce.)
